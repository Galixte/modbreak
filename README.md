# Modbreak BBcode

## Installation

* If you have a BBcode that uses '[mod]' -tags, remove it

* Copy the extension to phpBB/ext/ger/modbreak

* Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "Modbreak" extension.

## Styling
Some default styling is added in the extension. Change or override the definitions for 
'p.bbc_mod_head' and '.bbc_mod_text' if desired.
